# Uninformative Error Message in MATLAB Function

This repository demonstrates a common MATLAB error where an uninformative error message is thrown when an invalid input is provided to a function. The error message does not clearly explain the reason for failure or how to correct the input. The solution provides improved error handling that offers more context-rich messages to the user.
